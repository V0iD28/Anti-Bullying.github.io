	 <h1>Summary</h1>
	 <p>Bullying is growing a lot in our society nowadays. It affects students and people badly and many times it also affects their health. One loses confidence when one 
	 is bullied. The person starts being alone and stops talking to others. It affects his studies and his health. Some children start suffering from depression and they can a
	 lso commit suicide.</p>
	 <br>
	 <p>Bullying is very harmful and there are many ways to prevent it. Parents and teachers should always try to be friendly with children. This makes them comfortable a
	 nd they start sharing their feelings. They should also talk to the child who bullies others and know the reason. Parents should teach good manners and behaviours to 
	 their children. They must tell them that they should respect others and become friends with everyone.</p>
